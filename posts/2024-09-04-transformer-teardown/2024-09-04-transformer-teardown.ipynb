My engineer's brain wants to \"see the code\" behind high level concepts like embeddings, residuals, and multi-head self-attention. Yes, it's easy to find open source Transformer implementations, but they're often overloaded with configuration settings to the point that the main ideas are completely obscured.\n",

We'll dissect Hugging Face's default text-classification model, lay all the pieces on the table, and then trace a single inference through the stack from raw data to final prediction. We'll illustrate the main ideas from the Transformer literature with minimal, straightforward, working Python code. You may be surprised by how few steps are required!"

DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, lighter-weight version of the original BERT model that's easier to experiment with.

While the word \"token\" is often associated with text processing, the Transformer literature extends this to other data modalities as well. Examples include patches of an image or segments of an audio recording. In fact, tokenization is seen as a core strength of the Transformer architecture because it allows Transformers to process different types of data using a single, universal approach (Xu et al. 2023).\n",

Next, special tokens are injected to mark the beginning and end of the sequence. Each token is then converted into an integer-encoded categorical value using a fixed token vocabulary, producing the final sequence of \"input_ids\" that are passed to the next stage.\n",

Vaswani et al. realized there are more than one set of relationships involved in transferring context across tokens. A single application of SDPA would effectively water these down by averaging these together. The solution is to apply SDPA multiple times on separate query, key, and value embeddings. Each of these is referred to as an \"attention head\". Each head is isolated, leaving it free to learn distinct relational structures."

    "As the final stage in the Transformer pipeline, the Head stage maps the contextualized embeddings to task-specific predictions. In our case, the Head stage is responsible for turning the contextualized embeddings into a binary classifier that predicts whether the original text contains positive or negative sentiments. This sounds like a straightforward output layer until you realize that instead of one set of features, we have a sequence of features. And the length of the sequence is arbitrary. How do you connect an arbitrary length sequence of feature vectors to an output layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick is hiding in our contextualized embeddings. Each input embedding represents a single token in isolation. But the output embeddings have been infused with information from all of the tokens. This is why the common practice is to simply take the first output embedding and drop the rest. The first embedding represents the start of sequence marker `[CLS]`. Since the `[CLS]` marker token is added to every sequence, the first input embedding is always the same. In contrast, the first output embedding uniquely represents one specific sequence.\n",
