I am a software engineer, AI researcher, entrepreneur, leader, and early-stage startup veteran with 20+ years of experience building software products. I seek out hard problems worth solving. I lead by example. I fight for what I believe in without insisting on being right. I believe in technology's power to improve human life, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate to live and work in a time of so much possibility.
